LED Display Script with Full-Cycle Pulsing and Smooth Interrupt Transitions

- Reads the state from the shared state_management module.
- If no pending message: turns LEDs off.
- If a pending message exists: displays a gentle pulsing, multicolored light (256 steps).
- If a message is playing: displays a more active pulsing pattern (fewer, bigger steps).
- If a pulse cycle is interrupted, the current LED colors smoothly fade out.
